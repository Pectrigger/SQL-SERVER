1.)use db_name  (The db u want to )
GO

2.) Run this script to determine db encrypted
SELECT
db.name,
db.is_encrypted,
dm.encryption_state,
dm.percent_complete,
dm.key_algorithm,
dm.key_length,
db.database_id
FROM
sys.databases db
LEFT OUTER JOIN sys.dm_database_encryption_keys dm
ON db.database_id = dm.database_id;
GO


3.) Backup db use the GUI backup to do this


4.) Backing the certificate that is encrypting this db

First check for cert name : select * from sys.certificate; (Write the name dsame way u saw it on where certificate_name is )

BACKUP CERTIFICATE certificate_name TO FILE = 'C:\path\certname.cer
WITH PRIVATE KEY (file='C:\path\certname.pvk
Encryption BY PASSWORD= 'strong-password')

e.g : 
BACKUP CERTIFICATE PowerAccount_HQ TO FILE = 'C:\wallet\PowerAccount_HQ.cert'
with private key ( file='C:\wallet\PowerAccount_HQ.pvk',
encryption by password='Vnp-1234');

5.) Move the backup, certkey and certpvk to the new server folder

6.) On the new server create a master key
USE master;
GO
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'use password';
GO

Stil on the new server
7.) Restore the Cert
CREATE CERTIFICATE BAckupEncryptionCert
FROM FILE= 'C:\wallet\PowerAccount_HQ.cert'
WITH PRIVATE KEY (FILE = 'C:\wallet\PowerAccount_HQ.pvk', DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD= 'Vnp-1234')
